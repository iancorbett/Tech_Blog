Description: 

In this module, I created a application that can be used by people who enjoy blogs, making posts, reading posts from  others, and commenting and reacting to what they see on the blog. This project was made primarily to explore the capabilities of handlebars. I built this application from scratch, and it includes css, javascript, as well as many different handlebars files. There is a main handlebars file that applies to all of the pages on our application, as well as other handlebars files that pertain to just one page or functionality of our application. This application contains a few different functionalities. When opening up the page, you will be directed to the landing page, where you will have the option to click various links. If you click on the login link, you will have the options to log in, or create an account. Once logged in, you can make posts or navigate to the dashboard to read posts or to leave comments.

User instructions:

In order to run this application,  you will need to follow a series of steps. Firstly, you will have to clone the repo and open it in your own code editor. Then, you will open up the integrated terminal, and run the command "node server". You will then open up your browser and go to "localhost:3001". Here you will be able to use the application to sign up, make posts, make comments, etc. Examples are provided in the screenshots below.

Contribution guidelines:

In order to contribute to this page, you need to have permission from the repository owner. It is publicly viewable, but changes have to be from users that have been granted permission to make edits on the page.

Throughtout completing this project, I did not copy code from any other projects or repositories, but I did receive help from a tutor named Joem. I was having issues getting the posts all save, instead of just saving the most recent post. However, he was able to help me fix this issue. One other issue I had was that the comment functionality was not working. It would not show the comments, but we were able to get this bug fixed as well. One more fix he helped me make was with the timestamps. He explained how they work and helped me implement this feature in my application. In addition to these specific fixes, he gave me very useful advice and teaching on handlebars as a whole and its upsides and downsides.
